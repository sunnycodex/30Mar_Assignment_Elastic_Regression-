    "Q1. What is Elastic Net Regression and how does it differ from other regression techniques?\n",
    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "Elastic net regression is a type of linear regression that combines the advantages of lasso and ridge methods. It can handle multicollinearity, reduce overfitting, and select relevant features.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between elastic net and lasso or ridge is that elastic net has an additional parameter called lambda, which controls the balance between the l1-norm and the l2-norm penalties. When lambda is zero, elastic net is equivalent to lasso. When lambda is one, elastic net is equivalent to ridge. When lambda is between zero and one, elastic net is a compromise between lasso and ridge."

    "Q2. How do you choose the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression?\n",
    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "Choosing the optimal values of the regularization parameters for Elastic Net Regression involves tuning two parameters: one for the L1 penalty (Lasso) and one for the L2 penalty (Ridge). Here are some methods to do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Cross-Validation: Perform cross-validation and select the value of λ that minimizes the cross-validated sum of squared residuals (or some other measure). You can also use cross-validation to choose the optimal alpha in elastic net logistic regression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Information Criterion: Choose λ such that some information criterion, e.g., AIC or BIC, is the smallest.\n",
    "\n",
    "Alpha Selection: If you plug in 0 for alpha, the penalty function reduces to the L1 (Ridge) term and if we set alpha to 1 we get the L2 (Lasso) term. Therefore you can choose an alpha value between 0 and 1 to optimize the elastic net."

    "--\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantages**:\n",
    "1. Combination of Ridge and Lasso: Elastic Net is a combination of the two most popular regularized variants of linear regression: Ridge and Lasso. This means you don't have to choose between these two models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Feature Selection: It has the ability to select relevant features for prediction, while simultaneously shrinking the coefficients of less important features. This results in a more accurate and interpretable model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Handling Multicollinearity: The Elastic Net manages multicollinearity by maintaining or excluding highly correlated predictor variables from the fitted model.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Disadvantages**:\n",
    "1. Computational Cost: One disadvantage is the computational cost. You need to cross-validate the relative weight of L1 vs. L2 penalty, which increases the computational cost by the number of values in the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Risk of Overfitting: Another disadvantage is the flexibility of the estimator. With greater flexibility comes increased probability of overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assumption of Linearity: Like other linear regression models, Elastic Net assumes a linear relationship between dependent and independent variables, which might not be the case in many real-world scenarios.\n"
